    <string name="tip_t001_title">Declutter</string>
    <string name="tip_t001_body">How do you spend your evenings\? Watching TV\? On your computer\? Or both at the same time\? Plan one night a week to do something that doesn’t need electricity. Like sorting out your wardrobe or shed or other jobs you’ve put off. You’ll save energy, feel good – and you may even find that old T-shirt thas has been missed for ages.</string>
    <string name="tip_t002_title">Cosy on the couch</string>
    <string name="tip_t002_body">Make movie nights extra cosy. Light some candles, close the curtains and cuddle up with everyone under a blanket. Then drop your thermostat down by one degree. It’ll save you an extra pounds per month. Plus, you probably won’t notice dropping the temperature by one degree during the daytime.</string>
    <string name="tip_t003_title">Optimise your boiler</string>
    <string name="tip_t003_body">Did you know you can also control your boiler temperature\? Grab your boiler manual and see what the optimum temperature setting is. Too technical for you\? Just call our installers: +49 (0)231 438-26 98. They can help you optimize your boiler so you’ll maximize the money you save too.</string>
